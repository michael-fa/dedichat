# Dedicated Chat

This is a custom chat software, with the goal to provide custom server scripting ability.
The script language used is pawn, and we use basic but functioning techniques to do what we want to.


## Principle

The basic server/client structure is the bare-minimum at the point of installation.
We allow the following:
 - Client-Side scripting 
 -  Server-Side scripting
 - Network chat API (client/server gate (peer=>peer))
 - .Net Plugin for servers
   	  

## Ideas

The idea is to have the community make their systems. Not only is this cooler, this is a nice way of showing how the community can help each other. 
The chat mainly should be used to chat in a secure system with support of voip and file transfers.

# Scripting
Scripting will be a big part of this software.
If you don't want to rely on pre-existing scripts you need to learn [pawn](https://www.compuphase.com/pawn/pawn.htm).
